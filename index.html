        <h1>Holi - The Festival of Colors</h1>
        <img src="./2.jpeg" alt="Holi Celebration">
        <p>Holi, known as the festival of colors, is one of the most vibrant and joyous festivals celebrated in India
            and across the world. It marks the arrival of spring and the victory of good over evil.</p>

        <h2>History and Significance</h2>
        <p>Holi has its roots in Hindu mythology, primarily the legend of Prahlada and Holika. Prahlada, a devotee of
            Lord Vishnu, was saved from his evil aunt Holika, who was burned in fire while he remained unharmed. This
            symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.</p>

        <h2>How Holi is Celebrated?</h2>
        <p>The celebrations begin with Holika Dahan, where people gather around bonfires and pray for the destruction of
            evil forces. The next day, people play with colors, water balloons, and enjoy festive delicacies like gujiya
            and thandai.</p>

        <h2>Holi Around the World</h2>
        <p>While Holi is mainly celebrated in India and Nepal, it has gained popularity worldwide, with large
            celebrations in countries like the USA, UK, Australia, and Canada. People of different cultures come
            together to enjoy the festivities.</p>

        <h2>The Legend of Holi: A Mythological Perspective</h2>
        <p>Holi is deeply rooted in Hindu mythology. One of the most famous legends is the story of Prahlada and Holika.
            Prahlada, a devoted follower of Lord Vishnu, was constantly tormented by his father, King Hiranyakashipu,
            who was against his devotion. The king‚Äôs sister, Holika, tricked Prahlada into sitting on a pyre with her
            while she wore a fireproof cloak. However, due to divine intervention, the cloak flew onto Prahlada, saving
            him, while Holika burned to ashes. This event symbolizes the victory of good over evil and is celebrated
            through Holika Dahan, where bonfires are lit to commemorate this triumph.

            Another important legend is the divine love of Radha and Krishna. Lord Krishna, who had a dark complexion,
            was worried about whether Radha would accept him. His mother playfully suggested that he apply color on
            Radha‚Äôs face, which later became a tradition. This is why Holi is also seen as a celebration of love and
            joy.</p>

        <h2>Holika Dahan: The Ritual of Bonfire</h2>
        <p>The night before Holi, people gather to perform Holika Dahan, which involves lighting a bonfire. This ritual
            represents the burning away of negativity, evil forces, and old grievances. People throw wood, dry leaves,
            and sometimes even crops into the fire as a symbolic gesture of letting go of their past troubles.</p>
